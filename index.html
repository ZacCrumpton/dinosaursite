            I'm not at all qualified to write anything about dinosaurs other than the obsession
            that i had with the at a young age. As a child i would watch land before time, disney's dinsaurs(?) 
            and jurrassic park over and over again. It was quite a time to be alive. Everything
            you read from here on out is pure, correct opinion.
